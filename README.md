CMIP6 models scripts for masters research project.  

This respository has scripts where I analyse monthly rainfall and temperature output from 43 CMIP6 models with historical runs (from 1850-2014).
The purpose of these scripts is to investigate how volcanic eruptions affect climate.  
The scripts look at the five major eruptions since 1850 (Krakatoa 1883, Santa Maria 1902, Agung 1963, El Chichon 1982, Pinatubo, 1991), though ultimately focus on the Krakatoa eruption.  
The scripts look at 4 spatial regions: global, southern hemisphere, Australia, eastern Australia.  The aim is to put the regional Australian results into wider context by also examing the global and southern hemisphere spatial scales.  
Analysis includes creating time series, superposed epoch analysis (of the five eruptions), spatial plots, ENSO analysis and statistical analysis.
